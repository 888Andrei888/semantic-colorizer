# Sample Visual Studio "14" Roslyn Tagger

This is a sample editor extension for Visual Studio "14" that uses the 
Roslyn APIs to highlight parameter variables and field variables in distinctive
colors to make them easily recognizable.

The code is fairly simple, but it is not currently written using the
Async APIs in Roslyn.

This sample is based on the VS 14 CTP.
