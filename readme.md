# Visual Studio 2015 Roslyn Tagger

This is an editor extension for Visual Studio 2015 that uses the Roslyn APIs to highlight the following syntax types in distinctive colors to make them easily recognizable.

* Class fields
* Enum fields
* Static methods
* Regular methods
* Constructors
* Type parameters
* Parameters
* Namespaces
* Class properties
* Local variables
* Special types (built in)
* Normal types

The code is fairly simple, but it is not currently written using the Async APIs in Roslyn.

This extension is based on the VS2015 RTM.
