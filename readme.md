# Sample Visual Studio 2015 Roslyn Tagger

This is a sample editor extension for Visual Studio 2015 that uses the 
Roslyn APIs to highlight parameter variables and field variables in distinctive
colors to make them easily recognizable.

![Sample Text](http://winterdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RoslynColorizer.png)

The code is fairly simple, but it is not currently written using the
Async APIs in Roslyn.

This sample is based on the VS2015 preview.
